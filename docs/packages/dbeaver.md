- There is a set of plugins for certain databases (MySQL, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, PostgreSQL ...) and different database management utilities (e.g. ERD).
- It has a great number of features.
- DBeaver consumes much less memory than other popular similar software (SQuirreL, DBVisualizer).
- Database metadata is loaded on demand and there is no long-running “metadata caching” procedure at connect time.
