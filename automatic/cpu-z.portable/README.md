A freeware system profiler (system monitor) application that detects the central processing unit, RAM, motherboard chipset, and other hardware features of a modern personal computer, and presents the information in one window:

## Features

- Processor name and number, codename, process, package, cache levels.
- Mainboard and chipset.
- Memory type, size, timings, and module specifications (SPD).
- Real time measurement of each core's internal frequency, memory frequency.

## Notes

- You might need to use `--ignore-checksums` option when installing this package due to the fact that vendor overwrites historic download locations. Automatic updater will release new version with choco fix notation when that happens.
